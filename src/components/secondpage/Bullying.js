          Whilst even one negative incident (comment, gesture etc) is considered inappropriate behaviour and needs to be reported to Furlong Painting Manager for investigation, workplace bullying is characterised by persistent and repeated negative behaviour, directed at any person, that creates a risk to their own or others health and safety.<br/><br/>
Furlong Painting has a zero-tolerance policy for Bullying, Harassment, Violence, Aggressive and inappropriate behaviour, encouraging immediate reporting of an inappropriate or unwanted behaviour to management immediately.<br/><br/>
Contractors have a legal and moral responsibility to respect all parties at the workplace.<br/><br/>
All reports of bullying behaviour will be managed in a timely and confidential manner.
